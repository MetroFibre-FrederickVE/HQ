# Welcome to my HQ

THis will be the starting point for a range of repos im setting up for a few personal projects. Everything will be hosted on my [`GitHub`](https://github.com/MetroFibre-FrederickVE) for now.

## What is this repo for?

This 'HQ' will serve as a personal resume website and homebase to introduce and point to all other related or unrelated projects I want to showcase.

<!-- ```bash
# future install scripts can be added here as needed
npm create svelte@latest
``` -->

## Are you actively working on this repo?

Yes. 

If that were to change, I'd probably update this ReadMe... if i remember.
